Users Jython to parse Python commands in Skype.
This is an old project so I'm not too familiar with the details anymore

Steps to get it working:

1) Download this program and compile it (Eclipse works fine)
2) Run the program (cross your fingers and hope it compiles -- but I doubt it)
3) Go to your Skype window and click "Allow access" to let the program connect to your copy of Skype

Dependencies:
	Skype4Java
	Jython 2.5.3
